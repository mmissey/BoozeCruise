A JS/HTML5 drinking game

The rules are simple:

Guess if the next card from the deck will be higher or lower than the current card.

If you are correct, you move forward. If not you move backwards.

The goal is to go all the way to the right, and then back to the start again.

You must take a drink on every mistake.
You must also take a drink when crossing the “river”.

If the result is neither higher, nor lower, you must drink double.
